# Advanced-Learning-Algorithms


Overview

This repository contains my work and notes from Course 2 of the Machine Learning Specialization, which explores some of the most powerful and widely used machine learning techniques. The course covers both the theory and practical implementation of neural networks (deep learning) and decision trees, while also providing valuable guidance on how to make effective decisions when building real-world machine learning systems.

The course is structured into four main parts:

Week 1 – Neural Networks & Inference
Learn the fundamentals of neural networks and how to use pre-trained models to make predictions (inference).

Week 2 – Training Neural Networks
Understand how to train your own neural network using labeled datasets (X, Y), and how to optimize its parameters.

Week 3 – Practical ML System Design
Gain practical advice for building ML systems efficiently, such as deciding when to collect more data versus scaling up computation. These insights help avoid wasted time and ensure more systematic progress.

Week 4 – Decision Trees
Explore decision trees, a less-hyped but extremely powerful and widely used learning algorithm, and understand how they can be applied in real-world applications.

**Matrix Multiplication Requirements**

- The number of columns in the first matrix (A transpose) must match the number of rows in the second matrix (W) for multiplication to be valid.
- The dimensions of the resulting matrix Z reflect the number of rows from A transpose and the number of columns from W.
